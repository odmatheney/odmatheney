5. # About Me
6. ## My Interests
7. In my free time I enjoy martial arts, such as wrestling and boxing, as well as single player story-driven videogames. I also like to work on my car. I have a 2006 Subaru WRX.
8. ## Websites I Recommend
9. UFC Rankings: https://www.ufc.com/rankings - I find this website very useful for keeping up to date on what fighters are considered to be the best at the time. You can also filter by weight class, or look at the pound for pound rankings, which compiles fighters from every weight class into a top 15 list.
10. Reddit: https://www.reddit.com/ - Reddit is very versatile, as its uses can change depending on which subreddits you follow and engage with. I personally use it mostly for news and current events, but it can provide entertainment or educational information as well.
